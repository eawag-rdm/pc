# README
# ------
# Sections are function names
#
# Settings are contained in lists each list entry represents one function call.
#
# Within setting function arguments are defined.
#
# For each function (section) a whitelist and a blacklist can be defined.
#
# REGEX USAGE RULES:
# ==================
# 
# REGEX PATTERNS ARE ALLOWED IN:
# - blacklist: File paths that match these patterns are skipped
# - whitelist: Only file paths that match these patterns are checked
#
# Examples of valid regex patterns for blacklist/whitelist:
# - "test\.txt"           (matches test.txt exactly)
# - ".*\.log$"            (matches any .log file)
# - "temp.*"              (matches files starting with "temp")
# - "test[0-9]+\.txt"     (matches test1.txt, test2.txt, etc.)
#
# REGEX PATTERNS ARE NOT ALLOWED IN:
# - keywords: These are literal strings only, matched case-insensitively
# - disallowed_names: These are literal strings only
#
# Examples of valid literal strings for keywords:
# - "password"            (matches "password", "Password", "PASSWORD")
# - "api_key"             (matches "api_key", "API_KEY", etc.)
# - "/Users/"             (matches the literal string "/Users/")
# - "Q:"                  (matches the literal string "Q:")
#
# DO NOT USE regex patterns in keywords like:
# - "pass.*"              (will look for literal "pass.*" not regex)
# - "[Pp]assword"         (will look for literal "[Pp]assword")
